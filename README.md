# Generate-MAME-Playlist-for-RetroArch

Grab the dat file appropriate to your own collection here:
http://www.progettosnaps.net/dats/

Change the variables in the beginning of the PowerShell script as appropriate (most importantly pointing to the dat file that you just downloaded, and supplying correct ROM path/file extension).  Be sure to review all of the variables here as some options will limit the number of ROMs that get added to the playlist.  The default values may not be to your liking.

Run the script, then drop the generated playlist (.lpl file) into your playlist directory in RetroArch and you should be able to browse your games using the full ROM titles.
