# Generate-MAME-Playlist-for-RetroArch

Grab the dat file appropriate to your own collection here:

Change the variables in the beginning of the PowerShell script as appropriate (most importantly pointing to the dat file that you just downloaded), then execute the script to generate a playlist.  Drop this playlist into your playlist directory in RetroArch and you should be able to browse your games using the full ROM titles.
